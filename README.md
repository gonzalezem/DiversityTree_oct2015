Metatranscriptomic diversity in a genotype
==========================================

These interactive graphics vizualize the organism diversity by annotation, as it can be found in leaves of ten different willow genotypes (60 trees in total). Taxons are represented by a colored node (see legend). The size of the distal node (i.e. species taxon) is proportional to the number of unique transcripts from the same taxon. All results have been derived from transcriptmomic analysis based on Next-Generation Sequencing data (RNA-Seq, Illumina). The details of the experiment are given in <a href="http://www.google.com">the article</a>. Note: the link will be updated when the article is published.

Note: DE refers to Differential Expression (including only differentially expressed transcripts). "Full" means all transcripts are considered. Full may run slowly on lower spec computers.
