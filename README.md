Metatranscriptomic diversity in a genotype
==========================================

This experiment vizualizes the organism diversity as it can be found in leaves of ten different willow trees. Taxons are represented by a disc with a particular color. The last disc size (taxon: species) is proportional to the number of unique transcripts with the same taxon. All results have been derived from transcriptmomics analysis based on Next-Generation Sequencing data (RNA-Seq). The details of the experiment are given in <a href="http://www.google.com">our last article</a>.

Note: DE means Differential Expression analysis where we are only considering the differentially expressed transcripts. "Full" means all transcripts are considered. Depending on your computer, you may find the latter quite slow to run.
